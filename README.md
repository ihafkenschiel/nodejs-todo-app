A simple to-do list application built with Node.js and Express. This project is designed as a learning exercise to explore core Node.js concepts like asynchronous programming, middleware, error handling, and API interaction. 

## Features
- **Express Server**: Basic RESTful API with routes to manage to-do items.
- **Middleware**: Custom logging and error-handling middleware.
